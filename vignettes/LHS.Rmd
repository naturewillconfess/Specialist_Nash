# Introduction

LHS format is used in official Hearthstone competitions. Here's how it works:

* Both players create a set of $n$ decks
* Both players ban $m$ decks, if there is a ban phase
* Players secretly pick one non-banned deck and play a game between these decks
   + The winner of the game has to continue using the winning deck
   + The loser of the game can't use the losing deck for the remainder of the match
* The process repeats until one player has lost with all their non-banned decks




# Pick order
Let's first look at best-of-three LHS. To win, players have to avoid losing with 2 decks in three games. We will look at everything from the perspective of the first player. Let $W$ be a winrate matrix

$$W = \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{{w_{11}}}&{{w_{12}}}\\{{w_{21}}}&{{w_{22}}}\end{array}} \right)$$
Let $G_0$ be a payoff matrix of a pick order game before round one. Then

$$G_0 = \begin{pmatrix}
w_{11}(w_{12} + (1-w_{12})w_{22}) + (1-w_{11})w_{21}w_{22} & w_{12}(w_{11} + (1-w_{11})w_{21}) + (1-w_{12})w_{22}w_{21}
\end{pmatrix}$$
